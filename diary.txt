    After getting my first debit visa card, I finally revived my previous server on
Amazon Cloud Service by using its free tier EC2 virtual machine. It makes me a lot 
easier to continue my project and submit content on github.
    2 weeks later, 「私は日本に留学する」, for 1.5 years. That's why I decided to write
something to record my new life.
    Still, before leaving, my life stays boring and gray. One leetcode problem and 
some Japanese language learning are what I did today. And I always seem to worry 
about having some problem arriving Japan in this period.
    BTW, I tried purchasing a lewd game on dlsite with my new visa card to test its 
capability on Japanese websites.

    Today is a day to remember because my rank on leetcode comes to top 1 million, 
which is achieved by complete around 60 coding problems.
    And yesterday, since the dormitory for IPS school of Waseda University won't
be open on my day of arrival, I booked total 4 days in hotel near by school, which
cost approximately 26000 JPY. Fuck it.

    Life in Japan has settled down. I'm beginning to embrace my new life. Tomorrow 
I'll go to my first course in Waseda. My level of Japanese language is also making 
progress at the speed which can be discovered by eye. Oh whatever. I'm going to 
have new study journey on educational development board and by the first time go 
really further and deeper into an area which is embedded system. I mean I'm serious 
this time. I do not want to waste my time on those shit courses of my orginal 
University anymore and I'll cut my own path this time. May goddess of creators wish
me good luck.
